        <h1>dispGol - explanation of the animation</h1>

        <p>Here's an explanation of what the animation is showing.  We'll start with a brief account of Conway's Game of Life (GoL).  Even if you're already familiar with GoL, understanding the way the GoL rules are described here will be helpful for understanding what the animation does.</p>


        <h2>A brief description of Conway's Game of Life</h2>

        <p>Conway's Game of Life is a well known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a>.</p>

        <p>A GoL universe is an infinite two-dimensional grid of 
        cells, each of which is either empty or contains an atom.</p>

        <p>The state of the universe is updated at each moment to 
        determine whether cells in the next moment will be empty or 
        will contain an atom.  The next state of each cell is calculated by 
        looking at its current state as well as the state of its eight 
        neighbours (the eight cells surrounding it).  The following rules 
        are used:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>If a cell is empty and has exactly three neighbours containing 
        atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom</li>
        <li>If a cell contains an atom and two of its neighbours contain 
        atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom</li>
        <li>If a cell contains an atom and three of its neighbours contain 
        atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom</li>
        <li>In all other cases, then in the next state the cell will be 
        empty</li>
        </ol>

        <p>(note that the rules are typically described in a slightly 
            different fashion.  See for example the description <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Rules">in Wikipedia</a>.  However, these differences are only surface ones, and the description given here is functionally exactly the same as the more conventional descriptions.)</p>
            
        <p>The next state of the universe is 
        calculated according to these rules.  Then the rules are applied to that state to calculate 
        the one following it, and so on.</p>

        <p>Despite the simplicity of these rules, a GoL universe can 
        contain complex and sophisticated dynamically-evolving patterns, 
        including patterns implementing any possible computation.
        </p>


        <p>One well-known GoL pattern is the Glider, which moves across the board in a diagonal direction.</p>

        <p><img src="img/Glider.gif" /></p>

        <p>The above animation represents a typical view of GoL patterns.  We see the succession of universe states.  But we don't see the details of how these states are calculated.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the <tt>dispGoL</tt> animations is to show those calculations in a highly visual manner.</p>



        <h2>An explantion of what's happening in the animation</h2>

        <h3>The top and bottom grids and the updater</h3>


        <img src="img/screenshots/1-gridsAndUpdater.png" />


        <p>The animation shows the evolution of a GoL pattern over a 
        number of time steps, but unlike the other GoL animations it 
        shows <i>how each subsequent pattern is calculated</i> from the 
        last.</p>

        <p>The display contains three main components.</p>

        <p>The <b>top grid</b> is at the top left and shows the pattern's 
        state in the current moment.</p>

        <p>The <b>updater</b> starts off to the right and represents a 
        machine that calculates the next pattern from the current pattern 
        according to the GoL rules.</p>

        <p>The <b>bottom grid</b> is at the bottom left and shows what the 
        pattern will be in the next moment.  When the updater finds a cell 
        in the top grid that should contain an atom in the next moment it 
        will place an atom in that position in the bottom grid.</p>

        <p>After the updater has finished processing the top grid 
        and putting atoms on the bottom grid, the time in the GoL universe  
        moves forwards one time step.</p>

        <p>To represent this, both the grids scroll up, with the top grid 
        scrolling out of view off the top of the diagram, the bottom grid 
        scrolling up to where the top grid was and a new grid scrolling 
        into view from the bottom of the screen to become the new bottom 
        grid.</p>

        <p>And then the process can start over again to calculate the next 
        state.</p>





        <h3>The components of the updater</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/1.1-updaterComponents.png" />


        <p>The updater consists of a number of components.</p>

        <p>The <b>top arm</b> reads in input from the top grid and passes it onto the count component.  The top arm has a hole in it that is centered over the current cell on the grid.  This hole is large enough to fit in that cell and its eight neighbours.  It is like this because the GoL rules are applied to a cell, looking at its contents and the contents of its eight surrounding neighbours.  The top arm reads in the contents of these nine (one plus eight) cells and passes them onto the count component.</p>

        <p>The <b>count component</b> counts whether there is zero or one 
        atom in the cell being processed and the number of atoms in the 
        surrounding eight cells.  It then passes on the details of this 
        count to the match component.</p>

        <p>The <b>match component</b> determines whether the current cell 
        should contain an atom in the next moment.  Recall that (in how 
        we've described them) there are four GoL rules</p>
        <ol>
        <li>If a cell is empty and has exactly three neighbours containing 
        atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom</li>
        <li>If a cell contains an atom and two of its neighbours contain 
        atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom</li>
        <li>If a cell contains an atom and three of its neighbours contain 
        atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom</li>
        <li>In all other cases, then in the next state the cell will be 
        empty</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The match component contains representations of the first three 
        conditions and it checks the information from the count component 
        against each one of those.  If there's a match it sends a signal 
        to the new atom pen to put an atom on the bottom grid.  If there's 
        no match it does nothing (thus implementing the fourth rule).</p>

        <p>The <b>new atom pen</b> holds a new atom ready for putting it in 
        the current position on the bottom grid.  It will release that 
        atom if it gets a match signal from the match component.</p>

        <p>The <b>bottom arm</b> sits over the bottom grid, and has a hole in 
        it that will sit over the current cell.  The cell this hole sits over corresponds to cell the top arm's hole is centered over.  This is because the updater is trying to calculate whether the current cell should contain an atom in the next moment.  When the new 
        atom is released by the new atom pen it moves out over the bottom arm 
        to that hole, which it then slots through so it can fall into the current position on 
        the bottom grid.</p>




        <h3>Updater positioned over first grid cell</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/2-atFirstGridCell.png" />

        <p>The updater processes the top grid one cell at a time, starting 
        at the top left of the grid and moving through it row by row.</p>

        <p>In the above diagram we can see the updater at its initial 
        position over the grid.  The current cell is the one at the center 
        of the top arm's hole.</p>



        <h3>Update square moves from grid to count component</h3>

        <img 
        src="img/screenshots/3-updateSquareMovingToCountComponent.png" />

        <p>The top arm gets a copy of the current 3x3 square under its 
        hole, and sends it on to the count component.  This 3x3 square 
        sent to the count component, and from there to the match 
        component, is called the <b>update square</b>.</p>



        <h3>Update square in count component</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/4-updateSquareInCountComponent.png" />

        <p>In the above diagram we can see the update square in the count 
        component, ready for the count component to process it.</p>




        <h3>Number of atoms in update square are counted</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/5-updateSquareCountsCompleted.png" />

        <p>The count component counts whether there is zero or one atom in 
        the central cell of the update square, and counts the number of 
        atoms in the neighbouring cells surrounding the central cell.</p>

        <p>As can be seen in the diagram, it replaces the atoms in the 
        update square with those two counts.</p>


        <h3>Update square moves to match component</h3>

        <img 
        src="img/screenshots/6-updateSquareMovingToMatchComponent.png" />

        <p>After counting the atoms, the count component passes the update 
        square to the match component.</p>


        <h3>Update square counts checked against the three conditions</h3>


        <h4>Being checked against the first condition</h4>

        <img src="img/screenshots/7-updateSquareAtPos1.png" />

        <p>In the above diagram we can see the match component checking to see if the update square's counts match those specified in the first rule "1. If a cell is empty and has exactly three neighbours containing atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom."  We can see that while the central cell contains no atom, only one of its neighbours has an atom, so there will be no match here.</p>

        <p>Then the match component will try checking the update square 
        against items representing the second and third rules.</p>


        <h4>Being checked against the third condition</h4>

        <img src="img/screenshots/8-updateSquareAtPos3.png" />

        <p>The above diagram shows the match component checking the update 
        square against the third rule "3. If a cell contains an atom and three of its neighbours contain atoms, then in the next state it will contain an atom".</p>

        <p>It won't match this either, so the updater will not output any 
        atom and will just move one square across in the top grid and 
        repeat the same process again.</p>


        <h4>An example of a match with the 'zero-three' condition</h4>

        <img src="img/screenshots/9-zeroThreeMatch.png" />


        <p>The above diagram shows a happening later on in the 
        processing.  In this case the update square does match the first 
        condition (no atom in central cell, three atoms in neighbouring 
        cells), and the update square and the first condition's outlines 
        have been coloured green to indicate the match.</p>




        <h3>On a match, a signal is sent to put an atom in current 
        position on bottom grid</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/10-resultPulseMovingToNewAtomPen.png" />

        <p>Because there's been a match a signal (the green dot) is sent 
        down to the new atom pen.</p>


        <h3>New atom moves from new atom pen to grid</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/11-newAtomMovingToGrid.png" />

        <p>Now that the signal has reached the new atom pen, the pen 
        releases the new atom and it moves out towards the updater's 
        bottom arm.</p>


        <h3>New atom is placed on bottom grid</h3>

        <img src="img/screenshots/12-newAtomPutOnBottomBoard.png" />

        <p>The new atom then slots through the hole in the bottom arm and 
        is thus placed in the current cell on the bottom grid.</p>

        <p>Note again that this cell corresponds to the same cell position 
        as the central cell in the top arm's hole.</p>
